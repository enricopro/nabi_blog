# The Advent of Self-Sovereign Computing

*October 31, 2008.*

*Something happened silently, in an overly noisy world. But those who had ears to hear, could not ignore it.*

Bitcoin is born and the world is no longer the same.  
A chance to start over, starting with the most abused minority of all: *the individual*. Not the family, not the community, not the party, not the state, not society, but the individual.
Because Bitcoin is for *you* and for *me* before it is for “us”.

Among the many things it is, Bitcoin is software, free libre open 
software. It is software that you can download on your computer, modify 
and share. But it must be your computer, not someone else’s.

Why you may wonder.

No one is forcing it on you, but simply for it to work *for you*, the software must run *on your computer.* Don’t forget that if your computer is not doing the computations, then 
you are trusting someone else’s computer to do the math for you. There 
is no such thing as the cloud, it is just someone else’s computer. And 
there is no difference between trusting someone else’s computer and 
trusting that other person.

Bitcoin has reminded me of these lessons, and I want to treasure and share them, because they expand far beyond.

## Self-Sovereign Computing

*What’s Self-Sovereign Computing? Well, what’s a computer?*

At present, despite the astounding computing power they have achieved, personal computers are mostly used as network devices that delegate most operations to *servers*. This practice shifts the locus of control, from the hands of the individual to the companies operating such servers, which occupy the position of feudal lords in the
hierarchy that has come to be created on the Web.

Today, most people have given up their *autonomy to compute*, becoming unconsciously dependent on these servers.

Many like me have entrusted Google and the like with their data, their 
passwords, their searches, and their identity on the Web — and we are 
now seeing the effects because “[don’t be evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil)” simply doesn’t scale.  
Surrendering your autonomy to compute means reinstating the need to trust. But that’s not all of it. I am claiming here that surrendering your autonomy to compute is akin to outsourcing some functions of your very own brain.

*After all, what is a computer?*  
It is a bicycle of the mind! It is a tool that amplifies human intellectual abilities to 
spectacular magnitudes. A human being with a computer is powerful and 
intimidating to those trying to control him.  
That’s because he can *think*, think *effectively* and *autonomously*.

Empowered by a computer he can learn, create, communicate, share, work and [*recently even transact*](https://bitcoin.org/en/resources) from anywhere in the world with anyone in the world. Geography, 
ethnicity, nationality and religion no longer matter; anyone can be a 
first-class citizen in cyberspace on the basis of their own merits 
alone.

In fact, forget about citizenship, that’s the old model.  
Anyone can be a *self-sovereign individual* in cyberspace.

A computer is a gateway to cyberspace, but it is *your own computer* that makes you a self-sovereign individual in cyberspace. Without 
ownership, you are merely a tourist, who can be sent away at any time.

> Self-sovereign computing is the vision that recognizes the **autonomy to compute** as a prerequisite for the rise of the self-sovereign individual.

## Autonomy to compute

Autonomy to compute means first and foremost the physical possession of a
 computer, since nothing can prevent someone else’s machine from 
stopping serving you.

Second, autonomy to compute is about the software one uses. In general, using a [Service as a Software Substitute](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html.en) reduces your autonomy to compute because it effectively means outsourcing computations to someone else. Worse, such services seem convenient at first glance (*convenience*, what an ugly word!), but convenience really means hidden costs. It is only when you lose them, sold to the highest bidder without your knowledge, that your *privacy*, your *data*, and your digital *identity* appear valuable.

Third, it is important that the software you run is open source and even better [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software),
because running software where the processes are opaque and unchangeable limits your autonomy and freedom to know what your machine is doing — it limits your autonomy to compute.

And fourth, it is important for such software to implement *privacy by design*, since the decision to “selectively reveal oneself to the world” should concern only the individual and no one else.

# Conclusion

In the 21st century, it is impossible to be a self-sovereign individual without being computationally autonomous, for without it, one remains in the condition of being *easily governed*.

The computer is at its core a decentralizing technology, which favors 
the individual at the expense of institutions that seek to control him, 
but only if the individual is able to use it, and use it autonomously.

Bitcoin is unique in this sense because anyone can do the computations and anyone can check the math. Not only can anyone do it, but they are incentivized to do so 
because as the saying goes:

> not your node, not your rules.

Once again, a lesson Bitcoin reminds us goes far beyond the scope of the protocol and enters our lives: *autonomy to compute is a prerequisite for the self-sovereign individual.*
