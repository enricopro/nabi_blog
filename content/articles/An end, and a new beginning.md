# An end, and a new beginning

Many things have happened in the last period, about which we have not been able to keep you updated. Now we will.

Let's start with the first news: Enricopro has decided to leave the project because he simply had other priorities in his life, and and could not contribute as he did in the past.

Permeteo and I decided to continue the project together, but it was necessary to change our plans, not only because of the loss of a team member, but for other reasons: Cubit, as you have always seen it (on the website, on Twitter, on Medium...) is a very valid project, but one of very complicated execution.

To make it economically fasible to produce Cubit with the current components, we would need to sell 350 units. This is not an impossible goal, but not an easy one either considering that the high-end plug&play bitcoin-node market is still unexplored. In fact, currently only the Embassy Pro belongs this market (which btw has only the cost of a high-end node, not the performance/reliability).

In addition, the logistics and assembly associated with such manufacturing is complicated, too much for a team of only two people, who have no experience in this area.

For these reasons, we decided to start over, with a less ambitious but simpler project that will allow us to iterate more easily by calibrating to our customers' needs.

With the old Cubit we were trying to get to perfection in one shot, but not realizing that what is perfect for us does not necessarily coincide with our customers' needs.

I think a lot of startups make these kinds of mistakes, but that's okay, because sometimes you need to bump your nose and get hurt to learn.

## The new Cubit

Instead of finding a new name, we will rename the old Cubit to Cubit Pro and freeze this project for the future. The new Cubit will share the design and form factor with its more powerful brother, but nothing else.

*Two new design for Cubit*

Cubit is now based on the x86 [ODROID-H3](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-h3/) SBC from Hardkernel, and is equipped by expandible 16GB of non-ECC RAM, and it also won't have the integrated UPS. Many of you must be turning up your noses now, since we have always emphasized how important these features are for achieving the highest reliability possible.

We still believe what we have previously said, but this new Cubit is not meant to be the perfect product for every use, it is meant to be good enough for what 99% of people look for in a Bitcoin node, and that includes an affordable price.

In one feature, however, Cubit also manages to stand out from the previous design, namely the ability to use up to 3 disks, 1 NVMe and 2 SATA SSDs.

We will delve deeper into Cubit's features in a dedicated article in the future, but all in all, Cubit will be a mid-range product in terms of price, but with features that will enable it to outperform the Embassy Pro if not in terms of CPU power, in terms of disk allocation and Ethernet speed.

## The crowdfunding campaign on Geyser

To finance the production of Cubit and to finally launch Nabi Technology, we planned a crowdfunding campaign on [Geyser](https://geyser.fund/). Geyser is a crowdfunding platform made by bitcoiners for bitcoiners that allows anyone in the world to seamlessly contribute their sats to a project by harnessing the speed and convenience of the Lightning Network.

We have been following Geyser for some time and impressed by their work and the developments they have brought, we chose to use this platform for our own campaign.

Thanks to the Lightning network, they are able to lower the fees of more mainstream crowfunding platforms such as Kickstarter from around 8% to 2%. Moreover, for those using their own node, these fees do not apply. That's right, no commissions for those who use their own node!

## Conclusions

To be honest, the last two months have been critical and almost made us lose hope. Starting over with a new, much simpler project reminded us of the motivation for what we are doing and gave us a new charge.

We are now ready again to work to bring to the homes of Bitcoiners a quality node that they deserve. If you would like to help us in this endeavor, please consider donating or buying from our Geyser page when we open the campaign. 

Onward!
